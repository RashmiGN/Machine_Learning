New research and conservation work on the 1533 portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger has revealed that the painter made repeated small changes, each time giving Born even more chiseled features.Young Derich Born’s cheekbones were not always sharp enough to peel apples. New research and conservation work on the 1533 portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger has revealed that the painter made repeated small changes, each time giving Born even more chiseled features.The dazzling result bears an inscription on the parapet under Born’s arm, presumably composed by Holbein. Lifted from a near-identical tribute to Albrecht Dürer, the translated statement boasts: “If you added a voice, this would be Derich his very self. You would be in doubt whether the painter or his father made him.”The painting, newly conserved after work at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, was once owned by Charles I, and bought back by Charles II as he tried to reassemble the Royal Collection scattered under the politician Oliver Cromwell. It will now star in an exhibition at the Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace, opening November 10, which traces the work in England of the German-born Holbein, and his rise to become the favorite artist of the Tudor court.Born was not royal but a German merchant in the Steelyard in London, the Thames-side headquarters of the Hanseatic League — a powerful group of traders, at least seven of whom commissioned portraits from Holbein, with two now surviving in the Royal Collection, according to the exhibition catalog. Born was just 23 when he commissioned his portrait, and was evidently as arrogant as his features. He was expelled from England in 1541 after getting into an unwise dispute with the powerful Duke of Suffolk, and according to the show’s curator, Kate Heard, was still grumbling about it a decade later.','It’s safe to say that Harry Kane is enjoying life in Germany.The England captain made his high-profile move from boyhood club Tottenham to Bayern Munich in August and he hasn’t looked back.After netting a brace against Heidenheim on Saturday, the striker took his tally to 17 league goals this season. No player has scored more after 11 Bundesliga games, with Bayern’s former talisman Robert Lewandowski holding the previous record of 16.Kane, the league’s top scorer, also has four goals in the Champions League with Bundesliga leaders Bayern yet to drop points in the group stage.“It is impressive,” Bayern Munich’s sports director Christoph Freund said, per Reuters, after Kane’s double in the team’s 4-2 win against Heidenheim.“He is playing away from the UK for the first time and then he scores like that. The team also plays him into position. He is a phenomenon.”Kane, the Premier League’s second all-time scorer, was already considered a world-class talent before his switch from England to Germany, but it was unknown whether he could emulate his form at Tottenham.The 30-year-old has answered that question emphatically, ripping up the record books in the process.']\n",

    "articles_to_summarize = ['Whatever has gone wrong? After China rejoined the world economy in 1978, it became the most spectacular growth story in history. Farm reform, industrialisation and rising incomes lifted nearly 800m people out of extreme poverty. Having produced just a tenth as much as America in 1980, China’s economy is now about three-quarters the size. Yet instead of roaring back after the government abandoned its “zero-covid” policy at the end of 2022, it is lurching from one ditch to the next.','Donald Trump is promising a second presidency that would be an aberration in American history.The former and possibly future commander in chief aspires to strongman power if he wins back the White House next year. He believes his authority would be absolute. He wants vengeance against his political enemies. He’d pose the greatest challenge to the rule of law and the Constitution in modern times, seek to crush press freedoms and gut the machinery of government.None of this is speculation. Trump is saying and showing exactly what he would do in his rallies, social media posts, interviews, lawyers’ filings and even appearances in court that he uses to stigmatize the legal system. And Trump’s ambitions should be taken seriously because one year from the election, President Joe Biden’s reelection hopes are far from secure.Take Trump’s speech in New Hampshire on Saturday, when he chose to rip at national divides rather than foster unity on Veterans Day.“We will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country,” Trump said, using the demagogic technique of dehumanizing his opponents. He warned that “the real threat is not from the radical right. The real threat is from the radical left, and it’s growing every day.”']\n",
